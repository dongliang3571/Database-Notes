# SQL-Notes

### Difference between `VARCHAR` and `CHAR`
  - `VARCHAR` is variable-length.
  - `CHAR` is fixed length.
  - If your content is a fixed size, you'll get better performance with `CHAR`.


## MySql

`DELIMITER //` changes the statement delimiter from `;` to `//`. This is so you can write `;` in your trigger definition without the MySQL client misinterpreting that as meaning you're done with it.

Note that when changing back, it's `DELIMITER ;`, not `DELIMITER;` as I've seen people try to do.

```sql
DELIMITER //
create procedure insert_sales_proc(IN stor_id char(4),IN ordernum varchar(20), IN orderdate varchar(40))
    begin
    insert into sales values(stor_id, ordernum,orderdate);
    end//

create procedure insert_salesdetail_proc (IN stor_id char(4), IN ord_num varchar(20), IN title_id varchar(6), IN qty smallint, IN discount float)
     begin
     insert salesdetail values(stor_id,ord_num,title_id,qty,discount);
     end//

DELIMITER ;
```
